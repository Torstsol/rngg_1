# Roll N' gain ground
Roll N' gain ground is a turn-based strategy mobile game where the main objective is to conquer all the map zones by defeating the enemies in dice battles. You are given a set amount of dice, but the maps and number of zones you get are random. You have to create your own strategic game plan in order to capture as many zones as possible. Many of the game mechanics are borrowed from a similar game called DICE WARS

The game can be played with 2-4 players, and you can choose to play with other people, CPUs or both. The goal of the game is to conquer the other players zones. This is done by attacking an enemy zone next to one of your own and rolling a higher cumulative score than your victim. The concept is simple: if you have more dice in your attacking zone than your enemy has in his, you have a greater chance of winning the battle. You can also attack a zone with more dice than you, but then your enemy will have the upper hand.

Every game round each player has one turn to try to conquer as many zones as they can. When the round is over, you are awarded with as many additional dice as your largest contiguous area at the end of the round. You can either choose to randomly distribute the new dice on your zones, or you can take a more strategic approach and distribute them on your own terms. The game ends when one player as conquered all the playable zones.
